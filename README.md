# Hush Records
## Capstone 3 - Record Shop

Welcome to my readme for Hush Records! This project is my final capstone. We were tasked with debugging, developing, testing, and improving an online store!

### Features
- Responsive website layout
- Improved readability and visual hierarchy
- Debugged pre-existing API
- Functional user profiles and shopping cart features

### How to Run the Project
- Clone the Repository
- Run the API
- Open index.html in a browser

### Accessibility & Styling Improvements
Special attention was given to accessibility and visual contrast. Previously, the header did not meet WCAG contrast guidelines. Below are examples; we want to reach a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Additionally, I updated the product listing for a better uniform visual hierarchy.

#### Here is the old header:

### Optional Features Added
In addition to the core requirements, the following optional phases were completed:

- Phase 3: Shopping cart functionality
- Phase 4: Profile functionality

### Insomnia Testing
For this project, we needed to test our changes along the way with insomnia. Looking at the structure of the insomnia tests was hugely helpful! All of the tests should work, except the checkout functionality tests.

### Challenges & Learning Takeaways
One of the main challenges I faced was navigating a RESTful API. I learned more about mapping. I also learned to keep security in mind when using springboot and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. The most important thing I have found is to make sure my pathing between files makes sense and is correct.
